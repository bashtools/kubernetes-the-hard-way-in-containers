# Kubernetes the Hard Way - in Containers

## Features

* Lightweight.
  
  My 7 year old laptop is good enough to do kubernetes the hard way in containers, but was not powerful enough to do the VirtualBox version.

* Cheap.
  
  No need for GCP. You'll do it on your laptop.

* Screencasts included.
  
  You can just watch the screencast videos or use them when you're having problems.

* Verified labs.
  
  The documentation, transcripts and screencasts were created from a set of screencast files. Any command shown in the labs was the command that was actually run in the screencast.

## Accessing the Labs

There are two sets. One for `docker` and one for `podman`.

Seekable videos are in the `kthw-docker/images` directory only.

[Start the Docker version here](kthw-docker/k8shardway.md)

[Start the Podman version here](kthw-podman/k8shardway.md)

## Creating the Screencasts
